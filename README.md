## Configuration

### save_tabs

`save_tabs` is a yaml file to configure the scripts.

`cp save_tabs.example save_tabs` and modify `save_tabs`

| variable | description | default value |
|:---------|:------------|:--------------|
| sleep_time_save | sleep time after each key input by xdotool (seconds) in SaveTabs | 0.03 |
| max_tab | maximum number of tabs to scan | 128 |
| min_tab | number of tabs to scan at the start of scanning | 4 |
| shortcut_geturis | shortcut key to invoke `GetURIs` script | "control+g" |
| sleep_time_restore | sleep time after each key input by xdotool (seconds) in RestoreTabs | 0.3 |
| select_uri_delay | delay between keystrokes to select uri in RestoreTabs (milliseconds) | 100 |
| save_tabs_path | file to save tabs | ENV['HOME'] + '/.local/share/nemo/tabs' |
| socket_path | socket used by SaveTabs and GetURIs | '/tmp/nemo_' + ENV['USER'] + '.socket' |

#### sleep and delay

increase `sleep_time_*` and/or `select_uri_delay` if the script is unstable.
